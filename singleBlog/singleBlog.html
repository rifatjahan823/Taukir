                <h1>IT GETS BETTER: A GLOBAL MOVEMENT</h1>
                <div class="border-div"></div>
                <p>In 2010, more than 70,000 LGBTQ+ people and their allies uploaded videos and stories to provide hope
                    and encouragement to the LGTBQ+ youth with the message: It Gets Better. This was the birth of a
                    wildly successful global movement born out of social media. Today It Gets Better (IGB) is a
                    non-profit organization that reaches millions of young people each year with the mission to uplift,
                    empower, and connect LGBTQ+ youth around the globe through powerful storytelling campaigns,
                    educational programming and resources, and dynamic community building initiatives. The organization
                    also works with international affiliates in 19 countries to further spread their message of hope to
                    the LGBTQ+ youth.</p>
                <p >The It Gets Better Project connects daily more than 1.65 million followers
                    across  <a href="#" style="color:#B5B35C ;">Facebook</a>,  <a href="#" style="color:#B5B35C ;">Instagram</a>, <span style="color:#B5B35C ;">Twitter</span>, <span
                        style="color:#B5B35C ;">TikTok</span>, <a href="#"  style="color:#B5B35C ;">YouTube</a>, <span
                        style="color:#B5B35C ;">Tumblr</span>, <span style="color:#B5B35C ;">Twitch</span>, and <span
                        style="color:#B5B35C ;"> ItGetsBetter.org</span>. Their work has been translated into an
                    award-winning MTV special, a NY Times bestselling book, museum exhibits, and live performances – and
                    in 2012 was awarded the Governor’s Award for use of media to educate and inspire. </p>
                <p>We had the opportunity to meet with Chair and President of IGB, Paul Dien, to learn more about the
                    organization, the challenges they’re facing, and the strength of storytelling and social media.</p>

                <h5>What is the founding story of IGB? </h5>
                <p>Over ten years ago, It Gets Better was started by Dan Savage, who is a famous activist and columnist.
                    And this was really at a time post-Matthew Shepard where the national narrative was dark. And what
                    we were trying to do was create a movement that was empowering young people and create a hopeful
                    world where it didn't feel so dark and be a lighthouse of positivity. And then it just became a
                    grassroots viral campaign at first where videos were being uploaded by all folks from all walks of
                    life. And then we had celebrities, from Lady Gaga to RuPaul to President Obama, record their own
                    videos of messages and hope. But what's amazing about that founding story was it's rooted in social
                    media and flipping the script on creating these conversations of hope, again, when it feels so dark.
                </p>
                <p >And I feel like we're now at a time where these culture wars are happening but
                    now we have more resources and more relationships with content creators, where we aren't just
                    uploading videos of hope. I think we're meeting young folks, Gen Z folks, where they're at in this
                    moment. And I think that's the power of working with young people. It's constantly changing. The
                    demographics change, culture changes, the way they consume media changes. The culture has shifted
                    from 10 years ago when the conversation was very focused on white, cisgender men and we are really
                    celebrating intersectionality diversity. And I think that's such a critical part and a personal
                    mission for me because I became the board chair three years ago. It really put an authentic stamp on
                    diversity inclusion, so it’s been a fun next chapter. The background of where it started was
                    amazing. But now it's like, okay, how can we grow it and evolve it and make it bigger given the
                    culture wars and that the community is under assault in a different manner now?</p>
                <h5>What is IGB’s mission?</h5>
                <p >Our mission is really to uplift and empower LGBTQ youth. What we're
                    trying to do is provide storytelling that's uplifting and reflects the LGBTQ view, the importance of
                    why they matter, why our community matters, and what we can do to continuously celebrate and empower
                    young LGBTQ folks. It's a very tricky time for our community. There are over 220 anti-LGBTQ bills
                    that are happening across our country. So we are doubling down and we feel like we are a ray of
                    light during a dark time in the national narrative. And in addition, what's really exciting about
                    the organization is we have over 17 affiliates globally. So from countries from India to Brazil to
                    Colombia, we're really trying to create a footprint and a grassroots movement, not only in our
                    country, but around the world. </p>
                <h5>What are some of the biggest issues IGB is tackling at the moment?</h5>
                <p>The 220 anti-LGBTW bills in Congress. It's a huge one. And we've already seen some of them pass like
                    “Don’t Say Gay” in Florida and the anti-trans bill in Texas. And it’s gonna be an election year in
                    two years. So I don't think this is going away. This is a long-term strategy for us. And I think 50
                    states. 50 grants. 5,000 voices. is a big part of actual impact, to combat all the negativity and
                    darkness that the other side's trying to bring in terms of public policy.</p>

                <h5>How can people help or get involved, especially allies?</h5>
                <p >I think it's essentially just going to our website. There are a bunch of
                    different initiatives and campaigns in which you can donate to. There are also resources and content
                    that you can share to friends and families that might need this work. At the end of the day, it is
                    to help folks that might be struggling or to help families that may not understand. It's important
                    to just share that there are folks doing this work and to continue empowering others, especially our
                    young folks to create a more hopeful, inclusive world. I think our tone is not to be cheesy. We know
                    how critical this work is because we know how hard it is. I think you need the hope, the lightness,
                    the humour and the cleverness to combat the darkness. There's authenticity in acknowledging the
                    darkness. But I think what we're trying to do is face it with our own brand and our own messaging
                    that hopefully will inspire folks.</p>
