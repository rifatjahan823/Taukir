                <p>Hoa’s parents were refugees from Vietnam and Laos who resettled in the U.S. Sunny’s family immigrated from South Korea to the U.S. for better opportunities. Our parents showed us the value of hustling and how a hard work ethic can lead to success, especially in the face of adversity. We met in NYC and bonded over our cultural pride and in overindulging in Asian cuisines, all of which led to the birth of WE ARE CHIMMI.</p>
                <p style="margin: 12px 0;">WE ARE CHIMMI, short for "We Are Children of Immigrants," is a community building platform that celebrates the immigrant hustle. We sell accessories we grew up loving and <span class="fw-bold">donate 10% of profits from sales to organizations supporting immigrants and marginalized communities.</span> Currently, we are donating to Welcome to <span style="color: #B5B35C ;">Chinatown </span> and <span style="color: #B5B35C ;">It Gets Better</span>. Organizations we have donated to in the past to include:  </p>
